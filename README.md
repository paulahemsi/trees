## Tree Rotations

From [Balanced binary search tree rotations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4fnJZr8ztY)

The secret ingredient to most BBST algorithms is the clever usage of a **tree invariant** and **tree rotations**.

A tree invariant is a property/rule you impose on you tree that it must meet after every operation. To ensure that the invariant is always satisfied a series of tree rotations are normally applied.
